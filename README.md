# Grand Hotel Austria

Box inserts and models for Grand Hotel Austria and its extension Lets Waltz, based on the 2022 edition of the game.
The inserts were designed to hold some of the expansion cards and items in the base game box, since space in the expansion box is quite limited.

The following models were used:
  - Emperor pawn: Using the model by Qualith from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5005617
  - Grand Hotel Austria insert: Based on the SCAD design by Veritaas from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4942296, 
    but modified to fit some expansion items and meeple items.
